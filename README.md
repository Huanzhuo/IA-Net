# IA-NET: Abstraction-based Multi-object Acoustic Anomaly Detection for Low-complexity Big Data Analysis
We propose for the first time a novel one-stage method, called Information-Abstraction-Net (IA-Net), for the detection of abnormal events in multi-object anomaly detection scenarios by utilizing highly abstracted sensory information instead of the entire sampled data set to elevate the transmission and analysis needs of the system.

## Usage     
```
This repo is based on Pytorch 1.6 or higher, please install Pytorch before run.  
Download MIMII dataset and store in the same folder as IA-NET: https://zenodo.org/record/3384388 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
